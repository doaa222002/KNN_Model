# KNN_Model
KNN Model - Glass Classification This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to classify glass types based on their chemical properties using the Glass dataset. Grid Search is applied to optimize hyperparameters, ensuring the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing different glass types.
